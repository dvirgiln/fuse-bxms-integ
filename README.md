Fuse BXMS Integration Repository
===============

This is a code repository for the Fuse and BxMS integration components.

It is an optional package that can be added to an existing Fuse 6.2 and 6.3 installation. It contains libraries/components that can interact with other integration modules that have not been added into the default Fuse release. 

For the moment it provides the “glue” between Fuse and BRMS components/libraries. The fuse integration package gives the ability to install the components/libraries that have not been included in Fuse (for instance BRMS).

For the moment it contains:
  * Switchyard brms components: Rules-component and BPM component
  * Camel components used in kie:  kie-camel and  jbpm-workitem-camel components

Below, in the details, there will be references to versions. Check the compatible versions suited in the distribution you want to install:

${version.fuse.bxms-integration}
${version.drools}

Additionally a suite of quickstarts has been added as well as eap 6.4 and karaf support.

Execute mvn clean install
